    <h2> Mozzarella and Rosemary Pizza </h2>

    <p>This Gordon Ramsay's pizza recipe and is the best pizza you will ever eat! It comes together really fast and doesn't require many tools.</p>

    <p> I love Gordon Ramsay <strong> and </strong> I love his pizza. Give this a go and you will love it too! </p>

    <p> Very <em> demure</em>, very <em> mindful</em>. </p>
