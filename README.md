First, I made a webpage featuring multiple recipes.
I started with a pizza recipe so created a file for the page.
I listed out all the ingredients and steps in an ordered list.
I put a picture on the page and gave a description on the home page.
I repeated the steps til I had 3 recipes in total.
I checked ovre my code to make sure everything was working as it should.
